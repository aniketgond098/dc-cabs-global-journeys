# Routes

TanStack Start uses **file-based routing**. Every `.tsx` file in this directory
defines a route. Do **not** create `src/pages/`, `src/routes/_app/index.tsx`, or
`app/layout.tsx` — those are Next.js / Remix conventions. The only root layout
is `src/routes/__root.tsx`.

## Conventions

| File | URL |
| --- | --- |
| `index.tsx` | `/` |
| `about.tsx` | `/about` |
| `users/index.tsx` | `/users` |
| `users/$id.tsx` | `/users/:id` (dynamic — bare `$`, no curly braces) |
| `posts/{-$category}.tsx` | `/posts/:category?` (optional segment) |
| `files/$.tsx` | `/files/*` (splat — read via `_splat` param, never `*`) |
| `_layout.tsx` | layout route (renders children via `<Outlet />`) |
| `__root.tsx` | app shell — wraps every page; preserve `<Outlet />` |

`routeTree.gen.ts` is auto-generated. Don't edit it by hand.

## Booking API (server routes)

| Method and path | Purpose | Required query/header values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/catalog/countries` | Active countries | — |
| `GET /api/v1/catalog/regions?country_id=...` | Active regions in an active country | `country_id` UUID |
| `GET /api/v1/catalog/cities?country_id=...&region_id=...` | Active cities with active parents | `country_id` UUID; optional `region_id` UUID |
| `GET /api/v1/catalog/locations?city_id=...` | Active pickup/drop locations | `city_id` UUID |
| `GET /api/v1/catalog/vehicle-categories?city_id=...&pickup_at=...` | Active categories available in that city/date | `city_id` UUID; optional ISO `pickup_at` |
| `POST /api/v1/quotes` | Create a server-priced quote | Validated trip, route, pickup, category, and passenger data |
| `POST /api/v1/bookings` | Create a guest booking draft from an open quote | `Idempotency-Key` header and customer details |
| `POST /api/v1/payments/create-order` | Create or reuse a Razorpay test order for a guest booking | Booking ID and server-issued payment access token |
| `POST /api/v1/payments/verify` | Verify Checkout signature and fetch captured payment state | Booking ID, payment access token, order/payment IDs, signature |
| `POST /api/v1/payments/webhook` | Verify and process Razorpay payment events | Raw body and `X-Razorpay-Signature` header |
| `GET /api/v1/payments/status?booking_id=...` | Read authoritative booking/payment state | `x-booking-payment-token` header |

The `/book` page uses the catalog APIs, requests a server-priced quote, creates a booking through the idempotent booking API, and then mounts the payment checkout. The confirmation page loads status through the protected payment status endpoint. Do not pass the payment access token in a URL.

The quote endpoint rejects unknown fields such as `amount` or `totalAmount`. It invokes the database pricing resolver and quote function; it does not calculate a client-provided price. The booking endpoint accepts only a quote ID and customer details, then copies the quote snapshot and amounts into a `payment_pending` booking with payment status `pending`.

The current quote formula uses the selected rule's base fare, applicable distance/hour overages, per-day driver allowance, the night surcharge for local pickup times from 22:00 to 06:00, airport charge for airport routes, configured toll charge, and configured tax percentage. This uses estimated distance/duration values only when a selected rule has corresponding extra rates. Rates and their meaning are controlled by active database pricing rules.

The server runtime needs `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`; the legacy `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is also accepted. Set these as server secrets in the app's runtime. Do not use `VITE_` prefixes or expose these values to the browser.

Mapbox provides optional location suggestions, route visualization, and distance/duration estimates through the public browser-side `VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Restrict this token to the production site origins and enable the relevant Search Box, Directions, and Maps APIs in Mapbox. Booking does not require Mapbox: customers can search active catalog locations and continue if the token, map, or Directions service is unavailable. No fallback distance or duration is invented; route estimates are sent to the quote API only when available. Every selected location must still match the active booking catalog, and the server-side quote API remains authoritative for pricing.

Razorpay checkout is test-mode locked. Configure `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` with a `rzp_test_` key ID, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, and `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` as server-side Netlify environment variables. The API returns only the test key ID and an opaque per-booking payment token to the guest browser. The webhook endpoint must be configured for `payment.captured` and `payment.failed`; the webhook secret must match the secret configured in the Razorpay dashboard. Do not configure live keys with this implementation.

The Phase 5A seed contains temporary Asian Paints test pricing. It is only for booking-engine validation and must not be presented as public DC Cabs rates. Online quotes require active catalog records, vehicle availability, and a matching pricing rule for the selected city and trip.
