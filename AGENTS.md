## Project rules
- All site copy, contact details, fleet, cities and destinations live in `src/content/site.ts`; pages only render it — keeps facts in one auditable place.
- Enquiry form has no backend: it validates and opens WhatsApp (email fallback) with the details — the site is a lead-gen brochure, no Cloud needed.
- Never add stats, prices, specs, testimonials or claims not in the client's company material — client requirement for factual accuracy.
- No `lovable-assets` pointers or `/__l5e/` URLs. The new Mumbai vehicle photos are temporarily loaded from the public AI Studio repository because binary assets have not yet been copied into this repository; move them into `src/assets/images` before production and replace the temporary raw GitHub URLs.
- The customer `/book` flow uses the existing catalog, quote, idempotent booking and payment APIs; server pricing and payment state remain authoritative.
- Location and vehicle selections must come from the active catalog. MapLibre / OpenStreetMap search and route metrics are estimates and cannot bypass catalog validation or determine fares.
- Load MapLibre dynamically inside the booking map effect and clean it up; styles, tiles, geocoding and routing services remain outside SSR and non-booking pages.
